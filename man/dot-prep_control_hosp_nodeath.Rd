\title{Preprocess control arm for hospitalization stage (restricted to no-death)}
\usage{
.prep_control_hosp_nodeath(Y_H_c0, delta_H_c0)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y_H_c0}{Numeric vector of observed hospitalization times among controls with no death.}

\item{delta_H_c0}{Integer (0/1) vector of hospitalization indicators among controls with no death.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{h_ctrl_sorted}: sorted hospitalization times among controls w/ hospitalization.
\item \code{nh_ctrl_sorted}: sorted follow-up times among controls w/o hospitalization.
\item \code{m0h1}: count of controls (no-death) with hospitalization.
\item \code{m0h0}: count of controls (no-death) without hospitalization.
}
}
\description{
Within the subset of controls without observed death, split by hospitalization
status and return sorted hospitalization times for those hospitalized,
and sorted follow-up times for those not hospitalized (used to resolve ties vs losses).
