\title{Count wins/losses/ties at the hospitalization stage within no-death pairs}
\usage{
.count_stage_hosp(Y_H_t0, delta_H_t0, h_ctrl_sorted, m0h1, m0h0)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y_H_t0}{Numeric vector of treated hospitalization times among no-death treated.}

\item{delta_H_t0}{Integer (0/1) vector of treated hospitalization indicators among no-death treated.}

\item{h_ctrl_sorted}{Sorted hospitalization times among controls with no death and with hospitalization.}

\item{m0h1}{Number of controls (no-death) with hospitalization.}

\item{m0h0}{Number of controls (no-death) without hospitalization.}
}
\value{
A list with \code{wins}, \code{losses}, \code{ties} resolved at the hospitalization stage.
}
\description{
Restrict to pairs where neither side has an observed death, and implement
the hospitalization comparison by counting. Equal times are counted as ties.
