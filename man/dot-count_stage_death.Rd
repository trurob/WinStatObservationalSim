\title{Count wins/losses/ties at the death stage}
\usage{
.count_stage_death(Y_D_t, delta_D_t, d_ctrl_sorted, m1, m0)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y_D_t}{Numeric vector of observed death times in treated.}

\item{delta_D_t}{Integer (0/1) vector of death indicators in treated.}

\item{d_ctrl_sorted}{Sorted control death times (from \code{.prep_control_death()}).}

\item{m1}{Number of controls with observed death.}

\item{m0}{Number of controls without observed death.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{wins}: treated wins resolved at death stage.
\item \code{losses}: treated losses resolved at death stage.
\item \code{ties}: ties at death stage (equal times).
\item \code{t0_idx}: indices of treated with no observed death (for stage B).
}
}
\description{
Implements the exact all-against-all death comparison by counting, without
enumerating pairs. Equal times are counted as ties.
