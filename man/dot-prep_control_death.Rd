}
\arguments{
\item{Y_D_c}{Numeric vector of observed death times in control.}

\item{delta_D_c}{Integer (0/1) vector of death indicators in control.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{d_ctrl_sorted}: sorted death times among controls with death.
\item \code{m1}: count of controls with death.
\item \code{m0}: count of controls without death.
